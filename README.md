Vagrant Wordpress Installer
===


This is a frontend to my [vagrant_wordpress](https://github.com/rjocoleman/vagrant_wordpress) cookbook.  
It's designed to automatically get the cookbook and a vagrantfile down for an existing Wordpress project (or fresh source download).

When used with the included installer it will work with your current VCS. (i.e. This repo's `.git` folder is removed to prevent pollution).

My [vagrant_wordpress](https://github.com/rjocoleman/vagrant_wordpress) cookbook installs Apache, PHP, MySQL sever and required modules for deployment with Wordpress. It also configures Apache VirtualHosts to have you up an running in a virtualised environment in a flash.  


Dependancies
------------

* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)


What happens
------------
1. This repository's source is checked out via git to /tmp.
2. A gitignore is created (or your existing one is appeneded) to exclude the temp directories created.
3. Support files like `README.md` and `install.sh` are removed. This repo's `.git` folder is removed. 
4. The `Vagrantfile`, chef cookbooks and support files are copied to your current directory.


Usage
-----

Run this one-liner (in your project's root directory)  
`$ \curl -L http://wp.rjoc.me | bash `  
_Point to be noted is, there is a backslash before __curl__. This prevents misbehaving if you have aliased it with configuration in your ~/.curlrc file._  

Edit your new `Vagrantfile` or go straight to `$ vagrant up`.  
Point your browser to `http://localhost:2080/`  

Todo
----

* Remove install.sh's dependance on Git?


Known Issues
------------

* None.

Only tested on Mac OS X 10.8. Unlikely to work on Windows without a complete rewrite.
